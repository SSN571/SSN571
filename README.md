- 👋 Hi, I’m @SSN571 a really old Submarine Sailor who did ride the 571 boat.
- 👀 I’m interested in trying to create a database for senior volunteers who maintain small historical cemeteries in East Texas.
     Most of these records are on typewritten or even handwritten paper. One town lost some records in a fire. So I am hoping that
     I can digitize the records and create a database map of the cemetery.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Anaconda-Navigator, Jupyter, Python, SQL and database stuff. Is this a realistic goal?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a free, open source database as above. Any help and advice would be appreciated.
- 📫 How to reach me here a github I think that is what github is for, is it not?
